It is possible that Octane become unreachable, from a specific web browser. If this happens, it means that the cache of your web-browser is corrupted, and Octane does not seem to be able to recover from such problem. 

If you want to check if your Octane reachability issue is linked to cache problem, simply open either a private window, or a different web-browser and try accessing it. If the issue reproduces, then you can dismiss any cache problem, and your issue is probably network related.

If the issue did not reproduce though, it means that you need to refresh your cache for Octane, in case you still want to access it from your web-browser.

Here is how to perform this on Safari on macOS :

    1. Open Safari
    2. Open Safari Preferences
    3. Click on the privacy tab
    4. Click on manage website data
    5. Enter octane in the search textfield
    6. Click on Remove all

Voila, Octane should be reachable again now.
